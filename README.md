
This project is a Mini-Assembler for MIPS.

Which converts supported instructions into machine code written in hexadecimal value.

## Supports instruction :
    - add - sub - srl - sll - and - or - jr
    - la - lw - sw - addi - andi - ori - lui - slti - beq - bne    
    - j - jal

## How to use :
    - In code blocks ide open "Mini Assembleur.cbp" compile and run it
    - The assembly code file are located in the "Assembly File" folder in "main.txt" (don't delete this file)
    - The output file is located in the "Output" folder
